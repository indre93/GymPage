# GymPage

GymPage is an application that lets users keep track of their workouts by listing the exercises performed, and by describing the routines for each of those exercises. Users are able to see each other's workouts to stay motivated, and to get ideas on different exercises and routines performed by others. 

The Goal of this application is for users to be able to share what can't be shared at the gym, so other users can get the guidance needed based on what they are trying to achieve.
